        <p className="card__description">As Bangladesh continues to register more GI products, the hope is that Jamdani will lead the way, laying a path for other treasures like the Hilsa fish and Rajshahi Silk. With its newfound recognition, the beloved Dhakai Jamdani stands as a symbol of national pride, ready to drape the world in its storied fabric.

The weaving community, once confined to the shadows of their looms, now steps into the limelight, their skill recognized, their heritage honored, and their future secured. As the adage goes, "every Jamdani is a poem, penned in the language of the loom" – a poem that Bangladesh proudly shares with the world.</p>
