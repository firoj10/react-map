    "longdescription": "Jamdani (Bengali: জামদানি) is a fine muslin textile (figured with different patterns) produced for centuries in South Rupshi of Narayanganj district in Bangladesh on the bank of Shitalakhwa river.The historic production of jamdani was patronized by imperial warrants of the Mughal emperors. Under British colonialism, the Bengali jamdani and muslin industries rapidly declined due to colonial import policies favoring industrially manufactured textiles. In more recent years, the production of jamdani has witnessed a revival in Bangladesh. Jamdani is typically woven using a mixture of cotton and gold thread.In 2013, the traditional art of weaving jamdani was declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.In 2016, Bangladesh received geographical indication (GI) status for Jamdani Sari.Etymology : Jamdani was originally known as Dhakai (Daccai) named after the city of Dhaka (Dacca), one of many ancient textile weaving centers in Bengal region. Under the Mughal Empire the Persian term Jamdani came to be in popular use, since it was the court language of the Mughals. Jamdanis are popularly known as Dhakai Jamdani or simply Dhakai. The earliest mention of jamdani and its development as an industry is found into Dhaka, Bangladesh.Origin : An early reference to Indian origins of muslin is found in the book of Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and in the accounts of Arab, Chinese and Italian travelers and traders.Jamdani is a hand loom woven fabric made of cotton, which was historically referred to as muslin. The Jamdani weaving tradition is of Bengali origin. It is one of the most time and labor-intensive forms of hand loom weaving, and is considered one of the finest varieties of muslin, and the most artistic textile of Bangladeshi weavers. Traditionally woven around Dhaka and created on the loom brocade, jamdani is rich in motifs. In the late 19th century, T. N. Mukharji referred to this fabric as jamdani muslin. Weave : Whether figured or flowered, jamdani is a woven fabric in cotton. This is a supplementary weft technique of weaving, where the artistic motifs are produced by a non-structural weft, in addition to the standard weft that holds the warp threads together. The standard weft creates a fine, sheer fabric while the supplementary weft with thicker threads adds the intricate patterns to it. Each supplementary weft motif is added separately by hand by interlacing the weft threads into the warp with fine bamboo sticks using individual spools of thread. The result is a complex mix of different patterns that appear to float on a shimmering surface. The pattern is not sketched or outlined on the fabric butis drawn on a graph paper and placed underneath the warp. Jamdani is a fine muslin cloth on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used",
    "sortdescription": "Whilst the art of jamdani is on the decline due to current problems such as competition with cheaper and more lucrative clothing as well as lack of suitable remuneration for weavers. However, there have been a few encouraging signs in recent times.For instance, the Indian government awarded master weaver of Jamdani saris, Biren Kumar Basak from West Bengal with the Padma Shri award, which is the fourth highest civilian award in the country. Biren Kumar Basak also hailed the award and recognition of his work by Prime Minister Modi as a good sign for the future of the Jamdani community in Bengal.Exhibitions such as the Jamdani Festival of Wearable Art curated by Chandra Shekhar Shaha was held in July 2023 in Bangladesh in collaboration with the National Crafts Council of Bangladesh to illustrate sustainably produced and hand-woven jamdani saris. Moreover, brands such as TARINA by designer Tarina Sen are attempting to preserve the traditional crafts of jamdani by creating contemporary clothes. Labels such as TARINA are striving to help jamdani weavers in West Bengal and Odisha by reaching new markets, consisting of the younger generation, by creating attractive clothes that presents a harmony of modern and traditional designs.",

 "longdescription": "The history of muslin sarees in Bangladesh is deeply intertwined with the region's rich cultural and economic heritage. Muslin, a finely woven cotton fabric, has been produced in the Bengal region for centuries, dating back to ancient times.Early History: Muslin production in Bengal can be traced back to at least the 4th century BCE. The region's fertile soil and abundant water supply provided ideal conditions for growing cotton, and skilled artisans developed techniques to produce incredibly fine and delicate muslin fabric.Golden Age: The muslin industry reached its zenith during the Mughal period in the Indian subcontinent, particularly between the 16th and 18th centuries. Muslin from Bengal was highly prized for its quality and was exported to various parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. It was considered one of the finest fabrics in the world and was often referred to as woven air due to its sheer and lightweight texture.Decline: The muslin industry in Bengal faced a decline during the colonial period, particularly under British rule. Economic policies imposed by the colonial administration, including heavy taxation and the introduction of machine-made textiles from Britain, led to the decline of traditional handloom weaving industries, including muslin production.Revival Efforts: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in reviving the traditional art of muslin weaving in Bangladesh. Various government and non-governmental initiatives have been launched to support artisans, preserve traditional techniques, and promote the cultural heritage of muslin sarees. Efforts have also been made to obtain Geographical Indication (GI) status for Bangladeshi muslin sarees, recognizing their unique origin and quality.",
    "sortdescription": "Ancient Origins: Muslin weaving in the Bengal region dates back to ancient times, with evidence of its production found as early as the 4th century BCE. The quality and finesse of Bengali muslin were celebrated by travelers and merchants from distant lands.Mughal Era: The Mughal period (16th to 18th centuries) marked the golden age of muslin production in Bengal. Mughal emperors and nobility were known to be patrons of Bengali muslin, and it gained international acclaim for its exceptional quality. The delicate fabric was favored for its softness, breathability, and luxurious texture.Global Trade: Bengal's muslin sarees became highly sought after in global trade networks, reaching markets as far as Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. European merchants, including the British East India Company, recognized the profitability of Bengal's muslin trade and sought to monopolize it.Colonial Impact: The muslin industry faced challenges during the colonial period, particularly under British rule. British economic policies, such as heavy taxation and the promotion of British-made textiles, led to the decline of traditional handloom weaving industries in Bengal. Muslin production suffered as a result, and many skilled weavers were impoverished.Revival Efforts: In the post-independence era, efforts were made to revive the muslin industry in Bangladesh. Various government initiatives, NGOs, and international organizations have been involved in supporting artisans, preserving traditional techniques, and promoting the cultural significance of muslin sarees. These efforts aimed to revitalize the once-flourishing industry and provide economic opportunities for artisans",
